  <div class="post-content"><p>Github Pages supporting HTTPS certificates this year prompts me to get this personal blog ready (barely) after owning the domain for over 4 years.
This site is statically generated with <a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo</a>, using the default <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/">anake</a> theme.
The theme hasn&rsquo;t been modified at all because I&rsquo;m bad at doing webpage layout.
I believe a blog is about its content and the styling doesn&rsquo;t matter.
However, I would tweak the style a little bit until the website does not look too low-effort.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m thinking of posting here is personal reviews of cool things I bought or used. I cannot buy things, especially off internet, without doing extensive research. This is a personal habit. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a good one or not, but I hope my reviews will provide at least some insights to who stumbles upon my posts. You could expect reviews of anything from shampoo to furniture.</p>

<p>The reason to write in English instead of Chinese is I always awkwardly relate Chinese writing to the time of doing schoolwork when I was in high school. Writing back then wasn&rsquo;t fun. The content was almost never anything I wanted to write, and it takes too much effort to actually write with pen and paper. I was force to write for the homework and tests.</p>

<p>It has also came to my attention my Chinese sentenses composition has become alarmingly similar to machine-translated English sentences.</p>

<p>至于为什么要用英文，是因为写中文会有种小时候写周记（作文）的奇怪感觉。而且我中文写出来的句子简直就像从英文机翻过来的。。</p>
