      <description>The service in impeccable. Upon walking in to the first floor (lobby is at 28th), our luggage was taken care of (and delivered to our room shortly after we got in). At checkin we were greeted with cranberry juice. The staff handed me printed confirmation of my restaurant reservation, along with map instructions they made. Throughout the stay, every single staff member greeted us with smile. And our requests were always promptly answered.</description>
